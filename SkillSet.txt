SkillSet

A system where Skills arent used to define the outcome of a situation but to modify the way we do thing

Ex.
  Crafting
    To craft stuff we must learn RECIPES
      To learn recipe we must have FEATS and we must complete a minigame on the first try of the
      craft


we try to craft a hammer 3x3 memory
  we go and click on the learn recipe with the ingredients on the ground
    Minigame starts.
      Minigame will have a difficulty setting.
